      <h2 class="text-center">1. A bad wife</h2>
      <p>One day, I and my wife were going to shopping mall on foot as it is about 2 km from our home. Suddenly, she stpped walking.</p>
      <p>She : I don;t want to on foot. Take a CNG. </p>
      <p>I : Why? It is very close to our home. If we go there on foot, it will be very helpful for our health.</p>
      <p>Then I took a CNG and went there. After reaching there, We got out of the CNG and she said -</p>
      <p>She : Put your hand on my shoulder.</p>
      <p>I : Why?</p>
      <p>She : Don't talk too much. Just put your hand on my shoulder and let's go.</p>
      <p>Then, I did it and start walking.</p>
      <img src="blog1.png" class="img-fluid">
      <p>She: You are really very cute and always do that things what I tell you to do.</p>
      <p>She generally talks me very politely and praises me when she wants something from me.
        But, another time she doesn't want to talk me and always busy with talking with her friends and household works.
        But, I can't tell her anything as if I do so, she tells me that she won't cook for me and go to her father's home.
        As I can't cook and there is no time to me for cooking, I have to keep her happy all the time.
        On that day, she praised me so that she could buy wahtever she wants as I had to pay the bill.
        However, to keep her happy, I said-
        </p>
      <p>I: Yes, I have to do it as I love you.</p>
      <p>She smiled and said-</p>
      <p>She : always love me and don't look at other girls.</p>
      <p>I : Okay, mam. Now lets go.</p>
      <p>Then, she bought many dresses for her and I payed the bill. But I didn't buy any dress for me.</p>
      <p>Then we came out from the shopping mall and got in a CNG. Then she said-</p>
      <p>She : Have you buy any dress?</p>
      <p>I : No, I need not any dress.</p>
      <p>She : You did a great work by not buying any dresses. You should save money for our future. Do hardwork and earn money as much as possible. Don't waste your time by watching movies.
      I have a dream to buy a BMW. I think. you will fulfill my dream.</p>
      <p>After hearing this, I was surprised. She loves money and don't me. She should tell me that, you should buy at least one dress. But she didn't tell me that.
      Then, I took a decision that, I will work hard for myself, not for her and I will not buy any BMW as she don't love me. However, I said-</p>
      <p>I : Okay, I'll try.</p>
      <p>She : Try means? You have to do it for me. Remember it and I need the car within this year. If you don't do it, I </p>
      <p>I : I have told that, I'll do it and I'll do it for my love. You don't need to blackmail me.</p>
      <p>She : Oooh! so sweet. I am very happy to get you as my husband. I'll eagerly wait for that moment.</p>
      <p>I : Okay.</p>
      <p>Then we reached our home.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center">2. A Sleeping Girl</h2>
       <p>Oneday, I was sitting in a bench in a hospital. I had an appointment. Suddenly, a girl came and sit besides me. She said-</p>
       <p>She : Is doctor in the room?</p>
       <p>I : No, doctor have not come. We have to wait for him.</p>
       <p>She : Oooh! okay. </p>
       <p>After waiting few minutes, she started sleep and again wake up and said-</p>
       <p>She : I want to sleep. When will doctor come?</p>
       <p>I : I don't know. We need to wait. I think, only after a few minutes, doctor will come</p>
       <p>She : I need to sleep.</p>
       <p>I : Okay. Then put your head on my shoulder and fall asleep. You can trust me.</p>
        <img src="blog2.png" class="img-fluid">
       <p>She: Okay. Thanks.</p>
       <p>Then, she fall asleep on my shoulder and I was sitting idle and waiting for doctor. After a few minutes, doctor come.
         Then he started checking serially. My serial number was 78. So, I had to wait about 3 hours. But she woke up after 2 hours
         and went to the doctor's room immediately. I was surprised to see that as she was not called to go there. However, finally I was 
         called and went to the doctor's room. But I was again surprised to see the girl there as doctor's assistant. Doctor started checking me and started
         telling the medicine name and the girl started writing the prescription. After completing checkup, I came out from the room and retuned home.</p>
